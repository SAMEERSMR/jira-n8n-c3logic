(indicates attachments)\n- Are specific ticket keys referenced? (e.g., \"same as KAN-500\")\n- What type of similar tickets should you search for?\n\n**STEP 2 - CALL APPROPRIATE TOOLS:**\nBased on your analysis, call the tools you need. All tools will execute in parallel.\n\n**Tool Selection Guidelines:**\n\n1. **search_jira** - ALWAYS CALL with smart JQL query:\n   - Extract key terms from ticket summary/description\n   - Build relevant JQL query with project filter\n   - Examples:\n     * Ticket: \"Create landing page\" → Query: \"project = KAN AND summary ~ 'landing page' ORDER BY created DESC\"\n     * Ticket: \"Login authentication error\" → Query: \"project = KAN AND (summary ~ 'login' OR summary ~ 'authentication') AND status = Resolved ORDER BY resolutiondate DESC\"\n     * Ticket: \"Fix bug in checkout flow\" → Query: \"project = KAN AND type = Bug AND summary ~ 'checkout' ORDER BY created DESC\"\n\n2. **get_jira_issue** - Call IMMEDIATELY if:\n   - Ticket mentions specific issue key (e.g., \"similar to KAN-500\", \"duplicate of PROJ-123\")\n   - Call with the referenced issue key\n\n3. **get_jira_comments** - Call IMMEDIATELY if:\n   - Ticket mentions specific resolved issue key\n   - You want to see solution discussions right away\n\n4. **get_jira_attachments** - Call IMMEDIATELY if:\n   - Ticket summary/description mentions: \"screenshot\", \"image\", \"log\", \"file\", \"attached\", \"attachment\", \"see image\", \"error log\"\n   - Call for the current ticket: KAN-856\n\n5. **get_jira_changelog** - Call ONLY IN LATER ITERATIONS if:\n   - You found resolved tickets and need to understand resolution patterns\n   - DO NOT call in first response unless specifically needed\n\n**EXECUTION BEHAVIOR:**\n- You can call multiple tools in your first response\n- All tools will execute in parallel (simultaneously)\n- The system waits for ALL results before returning to you\n- You can iterate up to undefined times\n- When you have enough information, stop calling tools (return text to move to analysis)\n\n**DECISION EXAMPLES:**\n\nExample 1 - Simple task, no special mentions:\nTicket: \"Create landing page for new product\"\nYour response: [1× search_jira with JQL: \"project = KAN AND summary ~ 'landing page'\"]\n\nExample 2 - Ticket mentions files:\nTicket: \"Login error, see attached screenshot and error logs\"\nYour response: [1× search_jira with JQL: \"project = KAN AND summary ~ 'login error'\", 1× get_jira_attachments for KAN-856]\n\nExample 3 - Ticket references another ticket:\nTicket: \"Same authentication issue as KAN-500\"\nYour response: [1× search_jira with JQL: \"project = KAN AND summary ~ 'authentication'\", 1× get_jira_issue for KAN-500, 1× get_jira_comments for KAN-500]\n\n**SUBSEQUENT ITERATIONS:**\nAfter receiving results from your first tool calls, you may:\n- Call additional search_jira with different keywords if needed\n- Call get_jira_comments for resolved tickets you found\n- Call get_jira_changelog if you need resolution patterns\n- Or stop if you have sufficient information\n\n**REMEMBER:**\n- Analyze ticket content to decide which tools to call\n- Always include smart, relevant JQL queries\n- All tools you call execute in parallel\n- Don't call unnecessary tools\n- Every search MUST include: project = KAN\n\nTicket Key: KAN-856\nProject: KAN"

(indicates attachments)\n- Are specific ticket keys referenced? (e.g., \"same as KAN-500\")\n- What type of similar tickets should you search for?\n\n**STEP 2 - CALL APPROPRIATE TOOLS:**\nBased on your analysis, call the tools you need. All tools will execute in parallel.\n\n**Tool Selection Guidelines:**\n\n1. **search_jira** - ALWAYS CALL with smart JQL query:\n   - Extract key terms from ticket summary/description\n   - Build relevant JQL query with project filter\n   - Examples:\n     * Ticket: \"Create landing page\" → Query: \"project = KAN AND summary ~ 'landing page' ORDER BY created DESC\"\n     * Ticket: \"Login authentication error\" → Query: \"project = KAN AND (summary ~ 'login' OR summary ~ 'authentication') AND status = Resolved ORDER BY resolutiondate DESC\"\n     * Ticket: \"Fix bug in checkout flow\" → Query: \"project = KAN AND type = Bug AND summary ~ 'checkout' ORDER BY created DESC\"\n\n2. **get_jira_issue** - Call IMMEDIATELY if:\n   - Ticket mentions specific issue key (e.g., \"similar to KAN-500\", \"duplicate of PROJ-123\")\n   - Call with the referenced issue key\n\n3. **get_jira_comments** - Call IMMEDIATELY if:\n   - Ticket mentions specific resolved issue key\n   - You want to see solution discussions right away\n\n4. **get_jira_attachments** - Call IMMEDIATELY if:\n   - Ticket summary/description mentions: \"screenshot\", \"image\", \"log\", \"file\", \"attached\", \"attachment\", \"see image\", \"error log\"\n   - Call for the current ticket: KAN-856\n\n5. **get_jira_changelog** - Call ONLY IN LATER ITERATIONS if:\n   - You found resolved tickets and need to understand resolution patterns\n   - DO NOT call in first response unless specifically needed\n\n**EXECUTION BEHAVIOR:**\n- You can call multiple tools in your first response\n- All tools will execute in parallel (simultaneously)\n- The system waits for ALL results before returning to you\n- You can iterate up to undefined times\n- When you have enough information, stop calling tools (return text to move to analysis)\n\n**DECISION EXAMPLES:**\n\nExample 1 - Simple task, no special mentions:\nTicket: \"Create landing page for new product\"\nYour response: [1× search_jira with JQL: \"project = KAN AND summary ~ 'landing page'\"]\n\nExample 2 - Ticket mentions files:\nTicket: \"Login error, see attached screenshot and error logs\"\nYour response: [1× search_jira with JQL: \"project = KAN AND summary ~ 'login error'\", 1× get_jira_attachments for KAN-856]\n\nExample 3 - Ticket references another ticket:\nTicket: \"Same authentication issue as KAN-500\"\nYour response: [1× search_jira with JQL: \"project = KAN AND summary ~ 'authentication'\", 1× get_jira_issue for KAN-500, 1× get_jira_comments for KAN-500]\n\n**SUBSEQUENT ITERATIONS:**\nAfter receiving results from your first tool calls, you may:\n- Call additional search_jira with different keywords if needed\n- Call get_jira_comments for resolved tickets you found\n- Call get_jira_changelog if you need resolution patterns\n- Or stop if you have sufficient information\n\n**REMEMBER:**\n- Analyze ticket content to decide which tools to call\n- Always include smart, relevant JQL queries\n- All tools you call execute in parallel\n- Don't call unnecessary tools\n- Every search MUST include: project = KAN\n\nTicket Key: KAN-856\nProject: KAN"
